# Hello!

My name is Joseph Melancon. I'm 20 and currently a junior seeking a 
bachelors in Computer Science at University of North Dakota in Grand Forks,
North Dakota.

## My Skills

See below for a list of my skills. I also have a more traditional
"resume"-style page [here](/resume). Standard buzzwords shall be
relegated to that page.

| Skill | Depth of Knowledge |
|-------|--------------------|
| Python3 | Enough to be dangerous. This is my go-to language for most of my personal projects. Usually this comprises of web scraping or analyzing data. I've taken classes for Python at both University of Minnesota Twin Cities as well as University of North Dakota. |
| HTML, CSS, and JS | Enough to make this webpage! I don't usually do anything too fancy, but I've got a good enough footing to make servicable pages. My static site generator of choice is usually Jekyll. I also do web development for my university where I work in the Symfony framework for PHP. |
| Linux | I wouldn't call myself an expert, but it's my system of choice for my server, containers, and laptop. Debian and Alpine are my two primary choices. |
| Computer Networking | A touch. I play around with Mikrotik's RouterOS from time to time but I don't have much experience with devices from Cisco or the like. I have taken a networking class through UND and do have a good knowledge on the TCP/IPv4 suite. I've also done research on reporting packet flow in software defined networks. |
| Active Directory | Aside from working in Windows endpoint support at my part time job, I have played around a bit with deploying an Active Directory server using Samba. I've got a decent grasp on the structuring and managment of a domain. Still got plenty of learning to do though. |
| Git | I know a bit. I've managed my fair share of Github orgs and know the basics of commits, branches, and pushing over SSH. Merging conflicting commits is still a pain point, however, I grasp the basic idea. I just get filtered when `vimdiff` presents itself. Of course, this is a tool I use often while at work and occasionally during group projects. |
| Device Repair | I consider myself very handy with a screwdriver. I'm a frugal spender, so I often buy my devices used or broken and will repair them as needed. I can repair laptops, desktops, and cell phones and used to do so for my university's IT department as a part time job. I also do a bit of soldering, though I'm admittedly not very good at it. |

## My Work

Not too much to speak of here, at least not yet. A lot of my recent code is too 
small a project to consider uploading or is university property. 
Here's some of the stuff I can post though!

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [https://massmusicconvert.jmelancon.com](https://massmusicconvert.jmelancon.com) | A script I wrote that handles assisting in converting lots of music to different formats. It's not complete and may not ever be in a state I consider complete, however, it's still a script I use quite often to keep a folder of MP3 transcodes of my CD collection. I usually rip to Flac, so this script can get me to a format that I can bring into iTunes. |
| [https://data.team4198.org](https://data.team4198.org) | Data collection for First Robotics Competition Team 4198. I'm not on the team anymore as I graduated, but back in my senior year in high school, I orchestrated a migration away from pen and paper data collection to full digital data collection. Doing this saved many hours of work that would have been used to transcribe data from clipboards into Google Sheets. This link shows the fruits of that labor. A fork of an exisiting data collection tool by Aidunlin on Github was also made to fit our workflow. A frozen copy containing my changes can be found [here](https://github.com/jmelancon/MeanScout_4198). |
| Other odds and ends | There's other things I haven't listed here as I don't really see them as too notable. Most of my projects can be found [on my Github](https://github.com/jmelancon). |

## Contact Me

The best means of contact is to shoot me an email at [joseph@jmelancon.com](mailto:joseph@jmelancon.com). 
I don't really have any socials to speak of. My PGP keys can be found [here](https://keys.jmelancon.com/).
