# Hello!

My name is Joseph Melancon. I'm 20 and currently a sophomore seeking a 
bachelors in Computer Science at University of North Dakota in Grand Forks,
North Dakota.

## My Skills

See below for a list of my skills. I also have a more traditional
"resume"-style page [here](/resume).

| Skill | Depth of Knowledge |
|-------|--------------------|
| Python3 | Not too deep, but I can really get around in Python. This is my go-to language for most of my projects currently. I've taken classes for Python at both University of Minnesota Twin Cities as well as University of North Dakota. |
| HTML and CSS | Enough to make this webpage! I don't usually do anything too fancy, but I've got a good enough footing to make servicable pages. My static site generator of choice is usually Jekyll. |
| Linux | I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I do run it on my laptop as my primary operating system as well as running it on my home server. I know enough to get server software up and running which fits my needs. |
| Computer Networking | A touch. I play around with Mikrotik's RouterOS from time to time but I don't have much experience with devices from Cisco or the like. I have taken a networking class through UND and do have a good knowledge on the TCP/IPv4 suite. |
| Active Directory | Aside from working in Windows endpoint support at my part time job, I have played around a bit with deploying an Active Directory server using Samba. I've got a decent grasp on the structuring and managment of a domain. Still got plenty of learning to do though. |
| Git | I know enough with git to do basic work on my own. I don't do a lot of colaborative projects in git, at least not yet, so I haven't had the chance to get much experience in resolving merge conflicts. I primarily use Github to store my code, however, I have used Gitlab previously as well and am interested in deploying a Gitea server and possibly migrating my code there in the future. |

## My Work

Not too much to speak of here, at least not yet. A lot of my code is too 
small a project to consider deploying or contains sensitive information. 
Here's some of the stuff I can post though!

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [https://massmusicconvert.jmelancon.com](https://massmusicconvert.jmelancon.com) | A script I wrote that handles assisting in converting lots of music to different formats. It's not complete and may not ever be in a state I consider complete, however, it's still a script I use quite often to keep a folder of MP3 transcodes of my CD collection. I usually rip to Flac, so this script can get me to a format that I can bring into iTunes. |
| [https://data.team4198.org](https://data.team4198.org) | Data collection for First Robotics Competition Team 4198. I'm not on the team anymore as I graduated, but back in my senior year in high school, I orchestrated a migration away from pen and paper data collection to full digital data collection. Doing this saved many hours of work that would have been used to transcribe data from clipboards into Google Sheets. This link shows the fruits of that labor. A fork of an exisiting data collection tool by Aidunlin on Github was also made to fit our workflow. A frozen copy containing my changes can be found [here](https://github.com/jmelancon/MeanScout_4198). |
| Other odds and ends | There's other things I haven't listed here as I don't really see them as too notable. Most of my projects can be found [on my Github](https://github.com/jmelancon). |

## Contact Me

The best means of contact is to shoot me an email at [joseph@jmelancon.com](mailto: joseph@jmelancon.com). 
I don't really have any socials to speak of. My PGP keys can be found [here](https://keys.jmelancon.com/).
